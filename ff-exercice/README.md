## Welcome to my attempt at your challenge

This is how you can run this project:

# To run the server

In order to run the webserver you should use:

### `npm run server`

This will run the Webserver on [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) || [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)

### `npm run dev-server`

This will run the Webserver using nodemon in order to restart on any code change.
<br>
Will run on: http://localhost:4000 || http://127.0.0.1:4000/

# To run the application

### `npm start`

Will run the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make any code change.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
