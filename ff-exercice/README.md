## Welcome to my attempt at the Shopping Bag challenge

  

This is how you can run this project:

## First Steps

`git clone https://github.com/IgnorePT/ShoppingBagChallenge.git`<br>
`npm install`

## To run the server

In order to run the webserver you should use:

### `npm run server`

This will run the Webserver on [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) || [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)

### `npm run dev-server`

This will run the Webserver using nodemon in order to restart on any code change.
Will run on: http://localhost:4000 || http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## To run the application

### `npm start`

Will run the app in the development mode.<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make any code change.  

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

## Some Notes

#### Server side

I have to create the unit Tests for my app
